## Quick Install

```bash
npx @vudovn/ag-kit init
```

This command installs the `.agent` folder equipped with Phoenix/Ash and Next.js Web Gaming expertise into your project.

## What's Included

| Component | Focus | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Backend Specialist** | Elixir/Ash | Ash Resource-based declarative backend design. |
| **Game Developer** | Next.js Wrapper | Hybrid structure wrapping game engines with Next.js. |
| **Database Architect** | Ash/Postgres | Performance-oriented declarative data modeling. |
| **Workflows** | Custom | Commands optimized for Phoenix/Ash and NextJS-Game projects. |

## Why Elixir & Next.js?

Antigravity Kit combines the most efficient stacks of **2025 standards**:
- **Ash Framework**: Reduces code writing by 70% by defining business logic declaratively.
- **Next.js Wrapper**: Integrates game libraries (Phaser, Threejs) into modern web architecture.
- **Phoenix Channels**: Flawlessly provides real-time multiplayer experience.

## Structure

```
.agent/
├── agents/          # Ash and Next.js Game expert Agents
├── skills/          # Domain specific skills (ash-framework-expert, web-game-design etc.)
├── workflows/       # Project cycle commands
└── ARCHITECTURE.md  # Detailed architecture document
```

## Usage

### Using Specialists

Agents automatically understand the Elixir or Next.js code in your project and generate code according to Ash principles:

```
Use the backend-specialist to design a Ticket resource with Ash
Use the game-developer to wrap Three.js inside a Next.js component
```

### Workflows

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/plan` | Project plan starting from Ash Resource hierarchy |
| `/create` | Creating new Phoenix/Ash or Next.js projects |
| `/orchestrate` | Full-stack Elixir-NextJS synchronization |
